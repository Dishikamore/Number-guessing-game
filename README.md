# Number Guessing Game in C++

## Project Title
**Number Guessing Game**

## Project Description

This is a simple console-based **Number Guessing Game** developed in C++ where the program generates a random number within a given range (e.g., 1-100), and the player must guess it. The user is given feedback after each guess, whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number, and the number of attempts taken is displayed at the end of the game.

This game is a fun and engaging way to test your guessing skills while learning basic programming techniques in C++.

## Project Vision

The vision of this project is to:

- Provide a simple yet interactive game for users to improve their problem-solving and decision-making skills.
- Demonstrate how to use random number generation and user input handling in C++.
- Encourage beginner-level programmers to practice C++ and develop confidence in their coding abilities.
- Offer an opportunity for further extension (e.g., adding a difficulty level, multiplayer functionality, or even a graphical interface).

## Key Features

- **Random Number Generation:** The game generates a random number within a specified range, making each gameplay session unique.
- **User Feedback:** After every guess, the user receives feedback on whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct.
- **User Input Validation:** The game checks for valid inputs and ensures that users enter numerical values only.
- **Attempts Counter:** The game tracks and displays the number of attempts taken by the user to guess the correct number.
- **Replay Option:** After completing a game, the user is given an option to play again without restarting the program.
- **Engaging Gameplay:** Simple yet fun mechanics to keep users engaged and encourage repeated play.
